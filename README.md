# ComputationalCalculus

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that are inspired by the free Coursera Calculus course https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-calculus. We implement some of the concepts described in the lecture and play around with calculus ideas using the power of Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib. Feel free to fork and add your own analyses and experiments. In particular we explore the interplay between calculus concepts and their connection to linear algebra and computation.
